# Distributed Databases 

---

## Overview

This project explores different approaches to implementing a distributed counter system:

1. **Task 1**: Web counter with 4 backend options (In-Memory, File, PostgreSQL, Hazelcast)
2. **Task 2**: PostgreSQL-specific implementation with detailed testing
3. **Task 3**: Hazelcast distributed counter with CP subsystem and fault tolerance testing

Each task demonstrates different trade-offs between **performance**, **consistency**, and **fault tolerance**.

Please refer to the respective README files with results analysis in each task directory:
- [Task 1 - Web Counter Implementation](task1/README.md)
- [Task 2 - PostgreSQL Counter Implementation](task2/README.md)
- [Task 3 - Hazelcast Distributed Counter Implementation](task3/README.md)
